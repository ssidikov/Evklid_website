            grandiosity. As well as diagrams of connections can be described in

            self-sufficient and externally dependent conceptual solutions! It
            should be noted that a high-quality prototype of the future project
            determines the high demand for the positions taken by the
            participants in relation to the tasks set. We have to start from the
            fact that a high-quality prototype of the future project helps to
            improve the quality of experiments.
